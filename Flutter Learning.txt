Q.1 What are the various types of operators in dart ? Explain with Examples.


Ans: There are three types of operators in dart which are Arithmetic,Relational and Logical operators 

Arithmetic Operators : 
          Operator                          Meaning                             Example             
1             +                                   Add                                 (9+8) is 17 
2             -                                Subtract                              (9-8) is 1 
3             *                                  Multiply                             (9*8) is 72 
4             /                                    Divide                             (30/3) is 10
5            ~/                Divide giving a result in integer      (101~/10) is 10                                  
6            %                Get the remainder of a division        (101%10) is 1                                    
7            ++                              Increment                             (++3) is 4
8             --                              Decrement                             (--3) is 2  

Logical Operators : 

1          &&                And ,if all expressions are true     (A<20&&B<20) is false             
                                    It will only then show true  
2          | |                  Or , if only one expression is        (A<20 | | B<20) is true
                                     true it will also show true         
3           !                   Not , it will show the inverse of           !(A<20) is true 
                                           the actual answer  


Relational operators :

1             >                           Greater than                        (2>1) true 

2             <                            Lesser than                         (1<2) true

3             >=                 Greater than and equal to     { (2,3,4,5>=2) } true

4             <=                 Lesser than and equal to        { (0,1,2 <=2) } true

5              =                               Equal                               ( 1=1 ) true
 
6              !=                           Not equal                            ( 2 != ! ) true

Q.2 What will be the output in variables a, b & result after execution of the following script:
a. var a = 2, b = 1;
b. var result = --a - --b + ++b + b--;
Explain the output at each stage:
c. --a;
d. --a - --b;
e. --a - --b + ++b;
f. --a - --b + ++b + b--;

Ans . var result is 3 because decrement of 2 is 1 and when you subtract it by decrement of b which is 0 results 1 and when it is added by increment of b which is 2 it results 3  and at last it adds with  b which has decrement after it causing it to be 0 and the result is 3.

Q .3 Cost of one movie ticket is 600 PKR. Write a script to store ticket price in a
variable & calculate the cost of buying 5 tickets to a movie.

void main () {
  var costofoneticket=600;
 var totalcost = (costofoneticket*5);
  print(totalcost);  
}

 Q .4 How to get the difference of lists in Dart?
Problem: Consider you have two lists [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] and [3,5,6,7,9,10]. How
Would you get the difference as output? E.g. [1, 2, 4].

 Ans.
var list = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7};
var list2 = {3,5,6,7,9,10};
intList.removeWhere((e) => intList2.contains(e));
print (intList);

Q.5 What is the difference between these operators “?? And?”  ?


Ans.     -- - -  - - - - - - - - - - - - -  - --  

Q .6 What are the data types supported in Dart? Explain with Examples.

Number.
Strings.
Boolean.
Lists.
Maps.
Runes.
Symbols

a. First declare an array and assign the numbers of the table of 7.
b. Second declare another array and assign the numbers 1-10
c. Now write down the table of 7 using map.fromiterables method.

Ans.
 void main (){
var abc =[7,14,21,28,35,42,49,56,63,70];
var abc2 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];

print(data) ;  
 }




Q.8 Write a program that



a. Store the correct password in a JS variable.
b. Asks user to enter his/her password
c. Validate the two passwords:
d. Check if the user has entered a password. If not, then give message “Please enter your password”
e. Check if both passwords are the same. If they are same, show message
“Correct! The password you entered matches the original password”. Show “Incorrect password”
otherwise.




Ans.


 void main(){
   var correctPassword = "Jawan Pak Flutter";
   var userEnteredPassword ="Jawan Pak flutter";
   if (correctPassword==userEnteredPassword){
     print ('Correct! The password you entered matches the original password');
     
   }else{  
   print("Incorrect Password") ; 
      } 
  }



Q.9 Write a program to store 3 student names in an array. Take another array to
store score of these three students. Assume that total marks are 500 for each
student, display the scores & percentages of students

Ans.
void main (){
var name = ["Bilal","Owais","Ali"];
var marks = [432,451,411]; 
var percentage = [(marks[0]/500)*100 ,(marks[1]/500)*100,(marks[2]/500)*100];
print("MARKS:") ; 
print(Map.fromIterables(name,marks)) ;
print ("PERCENTAGE:");  
print (Map.fromIterables(name,percentage));  
}

Q.11 Write a program to replace the “Hyder” to “Islam” in the word
“Hyderabad” and display the result.

Ans.
 void main(){
   var lst = ["H","y","d","e","r","a","b","a","d"];
   lst.replaceRange(0,5,['I','s','l','a','m'] );
   print(lst);
 }

Q. 12  Write a program to generate your K-Electric bill 7. All the amounts should
be rounded off to 2 decimal places. Display the following fields:
a. Customer Name
b. Current Month
c. Number of units
d. Charges per unit
e. Net Amount Payable (within Due Date)
f. Late Payment Surcharge
g. Gross Amount Payable (after Due Date)

Where, Net Amount Payable (within Due Date) = Number of units * Charges per unit
& Gross Amount Payable (after Due Date) = Net Amount + Late Payment Surcharge

Ans .    void main(){
   print("\t\t\t\tK-ELECTRIC BILL\n\n\nCustomer name : Malik Wasiq ul eman \nCustomer month : July \nNumber of units : 392 pkr\nCharges per unit : 1.78 pkr \nNet Amount Payable (within Due Date) = Number of units * Charges per unit = 697 pkr\nLate Payment surcharge :300\nGross Amount Payable (after Due Date) = Net Amount + Late Payment Surcharge = 997 pkr \n");
